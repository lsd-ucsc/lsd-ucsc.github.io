**Time**: Fridays, noon - 1:05pm (PT) <br />
**Location**: The Internet / The LSD Lab (Engineering 2, Room 398) <br />
**Organizers**: Lindsey Kuper, Tyler Sorensen, Reese Levine, and Achilles Benetopoulos <br />

The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For fall 2025, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce/about) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/about) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

## Oct. 24

**Speaker:** Tom Lyon

**Title:** NFS Must Die! (and how to get Beyond File Sharing in the Cloud)

**Abstract:** One of the most important lessons learned in distributed computing and concurrency is
that shared mutable data is a bad idea . What is the purpose of a network file system? â€“ to provide
a shared mutable data space . There are many other problems with the NFS model at cloud scale. NFS
remains popular because its killer feature is access to large data sets, by network-unaware
applications, without having to first copy them. Using existing file systems, OverlayFS , and
NVMe-Over-Fabrics , we propose a new approach to achieve blazing-fast, highly scalable, and
consistent access to dynamic data sets. We solicit collaborators.

**Bio:** Tom Lyon is a mostly retired computing systems architect, serial entrepreneur and UNIX
Greybeard. His most recent startup was DriveScale, which created a disaggregated server management
system, and was sold to Twitter in 2021. Prior to DriveScale, Tom was founder and Chief Scientist of
Nuova Systems, a start-up that led a new architectural approach to systems and networking. Nuova was
acquired in 2008 by Cisco, whose highly successful UCS servers and Nexus switches are based on
Nuova's technology. He was also founder and CTO of two other technology companies. Netillion, Inc.
was an early promoter of memory-over-network technology. The Netillion team moved to Nuova Systems.
At Ipsilon Networks, Tom invented IP Switching. Ipsilon was acquired by Nokia and provided IP
routing and security technology for many operator and enterprise networks. As employee #8 at Sun
Microsystems he contributed to the UNIX kernel, led many networking and storage projects, and was
one of the NFS and SPARC architects. He started his Silicon Valley career at Amdahl Corp., where he
was a software architect responsible for creating Amdahl's UNIX for mainframes technology. Tom holds
numerous US patents in system interconnects, memory systems, and storage. He received a BS in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University.
