The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For fall 2025, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce/about) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/about) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Speaker:** Tom Lyon

**Title:** NFS Must Die! (and how to get Beyond File Sharing in the Cloud)

**Abstract:** One of the most important lessons learned in distributed computing and concurrency is
that shared mutable data is a bad idea . What is the purpose of a network file system? – to provide
a shared mutable data space . There are many other problems with the NFS model at cloud scale. NFS
remains popular because its killer feature is access to large data sets, by network-unaware
applications, without having to first copy them. Using existing file systems, OverlayFS , and
NVMe-Over-Fabrics , we propose a new approach to achieve blazing-fast, highly scalable, and
consistent access to dynamic data sets. We solicit collaborators.

**Bio:** Tom Lyon is a mostly retired computing systems architect, serial entrepreneur and UNIX
Greybeard. His most recent startup was DriveScale, which created a disaggregated server management
system, and was sold to Twitter in 2021. Prior to DriveScale, Tom was founder and Chief Scientist of
Nuova Systems, a start-up that led a new architectural approach to systems and networking. Nuova was
acquired in 2008 by Cisco, whose highly successful UCS servers and Nexus switches are based on
Nuova's technology. He was also founder and CTO of two other technology companies. Netillion, Inc.
was an early promoter of memory-over-network technology. The Netillion team moved to Nuova Systems.
At Ipsilon Networks, Tom invented IP Switching. Ipsilon was acquired by Nokia and provided IP
routing and security technology for many operator and enterprise networks. As employee #8 at Sun
Microsystems he contributed to the UNIX kernel, led many networking and storage projects, and was
one of the NFS and SPARC architects. He started his Silicon Valley career at Amdahl Corp., where he
was a software architect responsible for creating Amdahl's UNIX for mainframes technology. Tom holds
numerous US patents in system interconnects, memory systems, and storage. He received a BS in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University.

## Oct. 31

**Speaker:** Mingwei Zheng

**Title:** Semantic Bug Detection for Reliable Network Protocol Implementations

**Abstract:** Countless devices around the world communicate through network protocols, forming the backbone of modern digital infrastructure. Ensuring the security and correctness of these protocol implementations is critical, as flaws can lead to service disruptions, security vulnerabilities, and data loss. While extensive research has focused on low-level reliability through techniques such as fuzzing and traditional program analysis, true robustness also depends on high-level semantic conformance to the behaviors prescribed by natural language protocol standards. This latter aspect, semantic correctness, remains under-explored in the domain of network protocol testing.

In this talk, I will present three complementary efforts aimed at detecting semantic bugs in network protocol implementations. First, I will introduce ParDiff, a static differential analysis framework that identifies silent parser bugs by comparing multiple independent implementations of the same protocol. ParDiff automatically extracts finite state machines (FSMs) from programs to model protocol message formats and employs bisimulation and SMT-based reasoning to reveal fine-grained semantic discrepancies. Second, I will discuss ParCleanse, which leverages advances in large language models to automatically extract message formats from RFCs and generate both positive and negative test cases to evaluate parser correctness. Finally, I will present RFCAudit, an LLM agent designed to align RFC documents with source code to detect functional bugs beyond parsers. RFCAudit integrates an indexing agent that performs semantic indexing of source code, and a detection agent that conducts retrieval-guided consistency checking to uncover specification violations. Across these efforts, our research has uncovered over 100 semantic bugs in widely used network protocol implementations, demonstrating the promise of semantic bug detection for building secure and trustworthy network software.

**Bio:** Mingwei Zheng is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Xiangyu Zhang. Her research lies at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and software engineering. She focuses on building efficient and effective LLM agents for automated software development tasks such as code generation, software testing, and program repair, with the broader goal of improving software correctness, robustness, and trustworthiness. Her work has been published in top-tier conferences including OOPSLA, ASE, ISSTA, S&P, CCS, and NeurIPS, and has been recognized with the ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award (OOPSLA 2024) and a NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight. She has completed two research internships at Microsoft Research (RiSE Group) and is currently an Applied Science Intern at AWS AGI.

**Speaker:** Tommy McMichen

**Title:** Representing Data Collections for Analysis and Transformation

**Abstract:** Compiler research and development has treated computation as the primary driver of
performance improvements in C/C++ programs, leaving memory optimizations as a secondary
consideration. Developers are currently handed the arduous task of describing both the semantics and
layout of their data in memory, prematurely lowering high-level data collections to a low-level view
of memory for the compiler. This forces an early commitment to low-level memory representations that
obscures high-level structure and blocks memory layout optimizations.

In this talk I will describe MEMOIR: an SSA intermediate representation with data collections as a
first-class citizen. At its core, MEMOIR decouples the memory used to store data from the memory
used to logically organize it. Through its SSA form, MEMOIR enables static analysis on collection
elements and allows us to generalize traditional analyses and transformations to operate on these
elements. Furthermore, preserving these high-level abstractions in the compiler allows us to
automate memory optimizations that must be performed manually today.

**Bio:** Tommy McMichen is a final-year Ph.D. student at Northwestern University, advised by Simone
Campanoni, where he created and leads the MEMOIR project: a compiler intermediate representation
with data collections as first-class citizens. Tommy's research focuses on developing
language-agnostic intermediate representations that retain high-level semantic information to enable
more precise static analysis and unlock automatic optimizations on data organization and
representation. His work aims to bridge the gap between high-level programming abstractions and
low-level performance optimization through automated compiler techniques.

**Speaker:** Lasse Moldrup

**Title:** AWDIT: An Optimal Weak Database Isolation Tester

**Abstract:**  In order to achieve low latency, high throughput, and partition tolerance, modern
databases forgo strong transaction isolation for weak isolation guarantees. However, several
production databases have been found to suffer from isolation bugs, breaking their data-consistency
contract. Black-box testing is a prominent technique for detecting isolation bugs, by checking
whether histories of database transactions adhere to a prescribed isolation level. The complexity of
such testing has recently been shown to be polynomial for weak database isolation levels, but
existing testers have a large polynomial complexity, restricting testing to workloads of only
moderate size, which is not typical of large-scale databases.

In this work we develop AWDIT, a highly efficient and provably optimal tester for weak database
isolation. Given a history `H` of size `n` and `k` sessions, AWDIT tests whether `H` satisfies the
most common weak isolation levels of Read Committed (RC), Read Atomic (RA), and Causal Consistency
(CC) in time `O(n^(3/2))`, `O(n^(3/2))`, and `O(n * k)`, respectively, improving significantly over
the state of the art. Moreover, we prove that AWDIT is essentially optimal, in the sense that there
is a conditional lower bound of `n^{3/2}` for any weak isolation level between RC and CC. Our
experiments show that AWDIT is significantly faster than existing, highly optimized testers; e.g.,
for the ~20% largest histories, AWDIT obtains an average speedup of 245x, 193x, and 62x for RC, RA,
and CC, respectively, over the best baseline.

**Bio:** Lasse Møldrup is a second-year Ph.D. student at Aarhus University, advised by Andreas
Pavlogiannis. His research focuses on the intersection of algorithms, complexity theory, and
programming languages, particularly in problems related to testing concurrent systems. Lasse’s work
typically begins with a performance-critical problem, such as a particular testing task, and asks:
what is the theoretical limit on algorithmic efficiency for this problem, and can we design an
algorithm that matches it? His research has been accepted to POPL and PLDI, and he was awarded with
a Distinguished Paper Award for his PLDI paper.
