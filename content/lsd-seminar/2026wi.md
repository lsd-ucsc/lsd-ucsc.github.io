**Time**: Fridays, noon - 1:05pm (PT) <br />
**Location**: The Internet / The LSD Lab (Engineering 2, Room 398) <br />
**Organizers**: Lindsey Kuper, Tyler Sorensen, Reese Levine, and Achilles Benetopoulos <br />

The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For winter 2026, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.


Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

## Jan. 9

**Speaker:** Shanto Rahman

**Title:** Reliable Software Testing Using LLM and Program Analysis

**Abstract:** Software testing is essential for software reliability, yet modern test suites
frequently suffer from broken tests caused by nondeterminism or code evolution. These failures
mislead developers, reduce trust in testing, and allow real bugs to escape into production. In this
talk, I present my work on making software testing reliable using program analysis and large
language models. I introduce techniques to automatically identify and explain the root causes of
flaky tests using context-aware attribution, enabling developers to understand why nondeterministic
failures occur. I then present automated repair techniques, including FlakeSync for repairing
asynchronous flaky tests and UTFix for repairing unit tests broken by code changes. These techniques
achieve high repair success with low overhead and have been evaluated on large-scale, real-world
datasets. I conclude by outlining a vision for nondeterminism-aware reliability in emerging domains
such as cloud services, ML systems, and quantum software.

**Bio:** Shanto Rahman is a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University
of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor August Shi. Her research spans software engineering and AI,
focusing on reliable software testing under nondeterminism and code evolution. She develops
program-analysis- and LLM-based techniques to detect, explain, reproduce, and repair broken tests,
with publications in ICSE, OOPSLA, ASE, and ICST. She has gained industry experience through
internships at Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Her recognitions include MIT EECS Rising Stars,
UC Berkeley NextProf Nexus, and multiple UT Austin fellowships and awards.


## Jan. 16

**Speaker:** Lef Ioannidis

**Title:** Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification

**Abstract:** Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and
nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models
such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested
(co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the
guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs
creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by
structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of
compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural
temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas
and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform
compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high
level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and
liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed
consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.

**Bio:** I work in Programming Languages (PL) and Verification (Proof Assistants) in Microsoft
Research’s RiSE group. I completed my PhD in the University of Pennsylvania advised by Sebastian
Angel and Steve Zdancewic, where I developed Domain-Specific Programming Languages (DSLs) to improve
the reliability, security and privacy of computer systems, combining techniques from formal
verification and cryptographic protocols. Before starting my PhD I worked in industry as a Software
Engineer (Bridgewater Associates, Apple) and Tech Lead at UnifyID. I completed by Bachelor’s and
Masters in MIT and my thesis advisors were Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich. I am from
Thessaloniki, Greece and started my academic career at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
(AUTH).


## Jan. 23

**Speaker:** George Pîrlea

**Title:** Veil: Automated and Interactive Verification of Transition Systems

**Abstract:** Veil is a foundational verification framework embedded in the Lean 4 proof assistant
that makes distributed protocol verification both powerful and accessible. Improving on tools such
as TLA+ and Ivy, Veil provides a unified environment where testing and automated push-button
verification coexist with the full power of a modern proof assistant, all while maintaining
foundational soundness guarantees.

Unlike traditional verifiers, which are implemented as standalone tools and (optionally) use proof
assistants as backend certificate checkers, Veil is a Lean library, with all its functionality
entirely embedded in the proof assistant. We believe this approach has significant advantages over
traditional verifiers and that, in the near future, more verifiers will be built in this way.

In this talk, we describe our vision for building verifiers in Lean, and share our experience of
writing (and rewriting) Veil, and the lessons we have learned along the way. We will also give a
small tutorial of Veil, which you can try online at [https://try.veil.dev/](https://try.veil.dev/)

**Bio:** George Pîrlea is a final year PhD student at the School of Computing, National University
of Singapore, where he works on formal verification and testing of distributed systems. His research
focuses on making formal methods practical and accessible, with a particular emphasis on combining
automated and interactive approaches to verification. George is the lead developer of Veil.

**Speaker:** Martin Kleppmann

**Title:** Collaborative editors are distributed databases

**Abstract:** Collaborative editors for text, (e.g. Google Docs, Overleaf), spreadsheets (e.g. Excel
in Microsoft 365), graphics (e.g. Figma), and other file types have become an essential part of how
we work. However, their current architecture relies on centralised, trusted cloud services. This is
risky for various reasons: What if the government forces the cloud provider to disclose your
sensitive documents, or to stop serving you entirely? What if the provider is a startup that gets
acquired and shut down?

In this talk I will provide an overview of our research around Automerge, a library for building
decentralised, local-first collaboration software. It brings together ideas from CRDTs, distributed
databases, column-oriented data formats, version control systems, and end-to-end encrypted messaging
apps in order to enable collaboration without depending on any one trusted company.

**Bio:** Martin Kleppmann is an Associate Professor at the University of Cambridge, working on
decentralised systems and cryptographic protocols. He works with the Ink & Switch research lab on
local-first collaboration software, and advises the decentralised social network Bluesky. In a
previous life he was a Silicon Valley software engineer and entrepreneur, cofounding and selling two
startups and working on large-scale data infrastructure at LinkedIn. He is the author of the
best-selling O’Reilly book _Designing Data-Intensive Applications._
