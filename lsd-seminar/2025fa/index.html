<hr />

<p>The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you&rsquo;re an undergrad and need a permission code).</p>

<p>For fall 2025, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.</p>

<p>Talks will be advertised on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce/about" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce</a> (for anyone) and <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/about" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lsd-group</a> (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Tom Lyon</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> NFS Must Die! (and how to get Beyond File Sharing in the Cloud)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> One of the most important lessons learned in distributed computing and concurrency is
that shared mutable data is a bad idea . What is the purpose of a network file system? – to provide
a shared mutable data space . There are many other problems with the NFS model at cloud scale. NFS
remains popular because its killer feature is access to large data sets, by network-unaware
applications, without having to first copy them. Using existing file systems, OverlayFS , and
NVMe-Over-Fabrics , we propose a new approach to achieve blazing-fast, highly scalable, and
consistent access to dynamic data sets. We solicit collaborators.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Tom Lyon is a mostly retired computing systems architect, serial entrepreneur and UNIX
Greybeard. His most recent startup was DriveScale, which created a disaggregated server management
system, and was sold to Twitter in 2021. Prior to DriveScale, Tom was founder and Chief Scientist of
Nuova Systems, a start-up that led a new architectural approach to systems and networking. Nuova was
acquired in 2008 by Cisco, whose highly successful UCS servers and Nexus switches are based on
Nuova&rsquo;s technology. He was also founder and CTO of two other technology companies. Netillion, Inc.
was an early promoter of memory-over-network technology. The Netillion team moved to Nuova Systems.
At Ipsilon Networks, Tom invented IP Switching. Ipsilon was acquired by Nokia and provided IP
routing and security technology for many operator and enterprise networks. As employee #8 at Sun
Microsystems he contributed to the UNIX kernel, led many networking and storage projects, and was
one of the NFS and SPARC architects. He started his Silicon Valley career at Amdahl Corp., where he
was a software architect responsible for creating Amdahl&rsquo;s UNIX for mainframes technology. Tom holds
numerous US patents in system interconnects, memory systems, and storage. He received a BS in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Mingwei Zheng</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Semantic Bug Detection for Reliable Network Protocol Implementations</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Countless devices around the world communicate through network protocols, forming the backbone of modern digital infrastructure. Ensuring the security and correctness of these protocol implementations is critical, as flaws can lead to service disruptions, security vulnerabilities, and data loss. While extensive research has focused on low-level reliability through techniques such as fuzzing and traditional program analysis, true robustness also depends on high-level semantic conformance to the behaviors prescribed by natural language protocol standards. This latter aspect, semantic correctness, remains under-explored in the domain of network protocol testing.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will present three complementary efforts aimed at detecting semantic bugs in network protocol implementations. First, I will introduce ParDiff, a static differential analysis framework that identifies silent parser bugs by comparing multiple independent implementations of the same protocol. ParDiff automatically extracts finite state machines (FSMs) from programs to model protocol message formats and employs bisimulation and SMT-based reasoning to reveal fine-grained semantic discrepancies. Second, I will discuss ParCleanse, which leverages advances in large language models to automatically extract message formats from RFCs and generate both positive and negative test cases to evaluate parser correctness. Finally, I will present RFCAudit, an LLM agent designed to align RFC documents with source code to detect functional bugs beyond parsers. RFCAudit integrates an indexing agent that performs semantic indexing of source code, and a detection agent that conducts retrieval-guided consistency checking to uncover specification violations. Across these efforts, our research has uncovered over 100 semantic bugs in widely used network protocol implementations, demonstrating the promise of semantic bug detection for building secure and trustworthy network software.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Mingwei Zheng is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Xiangyu Zhang. Her research lies at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and software engineering. She focuses on building efficient and effective LLM agents for automated software development tasks such as code generation, software testing, and program repair, with the broader goal of improving software correctness, robustness, and trustworthiness. Her work has been published in top-tier conferences including OOPSLA, ASE, ISSTA, S&amp;P, CCS, and NeurIPS, and has been recognized with the ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award (OOPSLA 2024) and a NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight. She has completed two research internships at Microsoft Research (RiSE Group) and is currently an Applied Science Intern at AWS AGI.</p>
